SysOp-AI
​SysOp-AI is a self-contained AI orchestration framework designed for local language models (LLMs) to execute complex tasks, generate multi-language code, manage state, and persist data. It is inspired by blockchain principles, featuring a "Blockchain Strain" for ensuring reproducible and traceable AI outputs.
​Core Concepts
​Recursive Consensus: Utilizes multiple AI models to stabilize outputs through iterative convergence.
​ProofTracker: A cryptographic-style proof tracking system for AI outputs, ensuring traceability.
​Multi-File Project Management: Capable of generating and managing complex projects with automatic persistence to disk and a database.
​Event Logging & Memory: Provides a complete audit trail of all AI activities.
​Modular Design: Supports multiple languages including Python, PHP, Go, JavaScript, Bash, and SQL.
