1. Core Features

Proof Tracking (Blockchain Strain)

ProofTracker class generates a cryptographic hash from user prompts or timestamp.

Maintains three dependent indices:

1. cycleIndex → primary string-length-based index.


2. netWorthIndex → derived modulus-based counter.


3. entropyRatio → derived XOR/division ratio.



Implements “One Cycle Per Boolean Transformation”:

Only allows the cycleIndex to increment once per convergence check.


Supports entropy crosslining:

Incorporates external entropy (e.g., URLs, timestamps) into counters.


Tracks netWorthCondition:

Rooted value depending on even/odd cycleIndex.


Provides getCurrentState() → snapshot of all indices, hashes, and ratios.

2. File Handling and Persistence

AIDataStore

Stores:

memories → prompts, outputs, task IDs, and proof states.

blobs → files written to disk + metadata (language, preview, path).

events → logs for auditing (build steps, errors, hashes, git actions).

schemas → future support for SQL/DB schema persistence.


File Writing:

Writes files to CONFIG.OUTPUT_DIR using project-specific subfolders.

Syntax highlighting preview (first 5 lines in terminal).

Stores file preview in memory for auditing.

Adds events for each file write, including errors.


Supports dual storage:

Files written to disk and stored in blobs DB.

3. AI Orchestration

AIOrchestrator

Manages multi-model recursive consensus loop:

Iterates through models (CONFIG.MODEL_POOL) up to MAX_LOOPS.

Collects outputs and fuses them.

Checks convergence (hash equality) → triggers ProofTracker cycle.


Handles code generation workflow:

Generates code in Python/JS and adds # GENERATE_CODE markers.

Stores code in output folder and blob DB.


Provides simulated utilities:

_gitRepoAutobuild → simulates git init & commit.

_sshKeyManagement → simulates SSH key generation.


Returns final project file paths and proof states.

4. CLI Management

SysOpCLI

Entry point for Node.js CLI.

Default behavior:

Scans the current directory recursively.

Initializes a timestamp-based ProofTracker.

Hashes each file for auditing (ignores node_modules & output folders).


Commands:

--start → prompts for project name and task, starts build workflow.

--stop → stops the current workflow.

--ssh → simulate SSH key generation.

--wallet → simulate wallet operations.

--help → prints CLI usage instructions.


Uses ANSI color codes for:

Syntax highlighting (keywords, strings, comments, functions, variables).

Terminal headers, success messages, info, errors.




---

5. Syntax Highlighting Utility

colorize(code, language):

Applies color coding to keywords, strings, comments, and HTML/PHP tags.

Supports Bash, JS, Python, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS.




---

6. Output & Logging

Event logging:

Each step (memory save, file write, hash, git action) logs to events.


Terminal feedback:

Color-coded previews and status messages.

Tracks file lines, language, and hash previews.


Dual storage:

Data stored in memory (DB simulation) and physically on disk.




---

7. Project Workflow

Initiated with --start.

Steps:

1. Initialize ProofTracker.


2. Recursive consensus across multiple models.


3. Generate code files with syntax highlighting preview.


4. Save to disk (output_projects/<project_name>).


5. Update memory, blobs, and events.


6. Simulated git commit for versioning.



Terminates with:

Success → project files saved + netWorthCondition logged.

Failure → event logged with error and halted workflow.




---

8. Advanced Features

Timestamp-based default hashing for directory scans.

File scanning avoids node_modules & output folders for efficiency.

Full audit trail via events for reproducibility.

Supports multi-language projects with modular output handling.



---

✅ Summary:
This is a self-contained, modular AI orchestration CLI with:

Cryptographic proof tracking

Multi-model consensus

Syntax-highlighted code generation

Recursive file/directory scanning

Persistent memory & blob storage

Dual storage: DB + disk

Simulated git/SSH/wallet utilities

ANSI terminal feedback for developer experience


It is ready for multi-file project generation, fully auditable, and preserves proof-of-work for each task.
